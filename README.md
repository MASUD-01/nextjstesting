  screen.getByPlaceholderText: Selects an element based on its placeholder text, as shown in your code.

1 screen.getByLabelText: Selects an element based on its associated label's text. This is useful when you have labels associated with form elements like input fields.

 screen.getByText: Selects an element based on its visible text content. This is a general-purpose method for selecting elements based on their text.

3 screen.getByRole: Selects an element based on its ARIA role. This is particularly useful for selecting elements that are semantically marked up with ARIA roles.

4 screen.getByTestId: Selects an element based on a data-testid attribute. This is a common approach for selecting elements when writing tests.
